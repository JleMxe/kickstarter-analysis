Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Potential for Plays

An analysis was performed using data from kickstarter campaigns with a focus on theater in Great Britain

It is useful to note that campaigns are largely successful as indicated in the graph below.

                Specifically Plays have a good history of success

This is promising so a further look into when would be best to start a campaign was assessed. As can be seen in the chart below, the May to June time frame tends to be the optimal time to start a campaign

All good new so far. However, based on the initial parameters stated for the campaign, a need for 4000 pounds should be re-evaluated. Analysis shows that this amount is well outside the outlier range for pledges. An amount with a greater chance of success would be less than 2000 pounds.

In conclusion, while a kickstarter campaign for a play in Great Britain is certainly doable, it should be less than 2000 pounds and be started in the May to June time frame to have its greatest chance of success.
